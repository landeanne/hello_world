# hello_world

Hello there, first time i ate water melons, it tasted like a wet mattress, pwaaah! Disgusting
Now after trying several times, I cannot do without it.
Saturday afternoon, the sun is high up in the sky, beautiful day for a swim but the streets are empty. Where did everyone go? Is it an apocalypse?
